## Mark 1:
Uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to determine the sentiment of a particular tweet after cleaning and preprocessing

## Mark 2:
Uses pure statistical methods to compare the tweet to a pre-defined dictionary of positive and negative words to determine the sentiment.

The application fetches around 400 tweets about a particular subject but searching for tweets that tend to have an opinion in it using Twitter API V2. then it classifies each tweet to positive, negative,
and neutral tweets. And then you can analyze the data using traditional data analysis techniques.

We are looking forward to automate the data analysis step in future versions.
